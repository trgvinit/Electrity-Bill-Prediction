#Electricity Bill Prediction

Overview:
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline for predicting electricty bills using linear regression model.
The workflow includes data loading, cleaning, encoding of categorical features, splitting the dataset, standardizing features, 
training a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance using the RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
and Mean Squared Error(MSE).

Requirements:
>numpy
>sklearn
>pandas
